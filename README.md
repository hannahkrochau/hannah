## My job
**If I manage you**: I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company. I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our team's and Zapier's values.

**If you manage me**: I believe that I'm here to help be the voice of individual contributors and will advocate fiercely for their best interests in relation to Zapier. I believe the best thing we can do as an organization is to keep Zapier a company that treats support like first-class citizens and is an attractive place for support professionals to work. The manager-direct relationship has an inherent power differential, and I will likely make a point to say this frequently.

When it comes to strategic and operational decision making, my job is to advocate for what I believe to be in the best interests of the team. If our final direction is not one that I advocated for, it is still my responsibility to communicate the decision and get buy-in from individual contributors.

## How I communicate
This may be somewhat unusual, but I prefer written to spoken communication (including when giving and receiving feedback). It gives me a chance to organize my thoughts before sharing them and also gives me a chance to sit with what you’ve said before I react to it. Because tone can be difficult to discern via text, I will make a good faith effort to give you the benefit of the doubt and will expect the same from you. (That said, I know that there are often things that make sense to discuss synchronously. When that’s the case, I prefer to have a rough agenda ahead of time so that I can prepare my thoughts. If that's not possible I'm still happy to meet, but you may find that I have less to say.)

If you’re communicating with me please be direct and explicit. If you have a problem or a concern, please tell me! I am unlikely to be permanently offended, even if I need time to process what I’ve heard.

When I communicate with other people,  I can be diplomatic to a fault. I like to say things in the way that I think they'll be best received, but this can lead to me spending longer than I should mulling over feedback or a specific conversation. I'm working on being better at defaulting to action, but don't be afraid to call me out if you see this.

When discussing strategic goals or decisions, I believe communication should be clear but considerate. If we disagree about a topic, I will to my best to remember that you are advocating for a specific course of action and not denigrating me or my ideas (and appreciate you making an effort to do the same). I appreciate an environment where everyone wins together.

## My work style

I’m empathetic. I understand and relate well to others’ feelings, and can understand how these can affect performance both positively and negatively. I consider myself an extrovert, but I spend a lot of emotional energy in my interactions with other people. When that happens I may need time to withdraw and reset in order to bring my best work back to the table. (For this reason, you may notice that I often prefer to be on the fringes of the action during retreats, and not in the thick of it.)

I’m externally cooperative but internally competitive. That is, I am happy to work towards the team’s best interests and not for the purpose of express recognition. However, I need goals that I can use to frame and direct my own personal growth. Without clear growth avenues, I tend to feel frustrated or unmotivated.

I have a tendency to marinate. If you come to me with a question or a project, you may feel as thought I'm not making progress, but my wheels are usually spinning in the background as I try to solidify my thoughts. While I’m getting better at defaulting to action, I especially don’t like to be rushed by deadlines that I perceive as arbitrary for this reason. In a similar vein, I love starting new projects, but sometimes need encouragement to finish in-progress projects. I tend to be more idea-oriented than execution-oriented.

Psychological safety is very important to me. It often takes me time to build enough trust with my coworkers, to observe interpersonal relationship dynamics, and to feel confident enough in my abilities to speak my mind freely and openly. Because of this, I get easily discouraged if I perceive that my opinions aren’t being heard. If I manage you, this can manifest as me coming across as very businesslike or cold at first. Please don't be afraid to ask me questions or get to know me because of this, and feel free to call me out!


## My pet peeves and shortcomings

I don’t have many pet peeves, but one that especially bothers me is ego, especially if I think someone is talking too much and listening too little. I appreciate confidence in others, but get quickly frustrated if I perceive someone to be talking for the sake of hearing themselves talk. I also get frustrated if I interpret someone’s behavior as overtly self-promotional.

I’m working on getting better, but I’m not a very organized person. If you ask me for something and don’t hear back, please don’t hesitate to follow up - I promise not to be annoyed.

I will sometimes avoid conflict. I’m working on this too, but again, please call me out on this. 

I can be very self-conscious and as a result hesitate to speak my mind or bring up new ideas.

I can be a bit of a control freak and sometimes avoid delegating or sharing my work as a result. Call it out! 

## Caveat

Take this document with a grain of salt: I wrote it! I have never experienced having me as a manager. If I'm your manager and something here seems off, open a pull request or issue, or (probably more comfortably) bring it up to me in one-on-one or over Slack.
